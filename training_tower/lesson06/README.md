# WorkFlow Template

The basic idea of a workflow is to link multiple Job Templates together. They may or may not share inventory, Playbooks or even permissions. The links can be conditional: 

* if job template A succeeds, job template B is automatically executed afterwards
* but in case of failure, job template C will be run. 

And the workflows are not even limited to Job Templates, but can also include project or inventory updates.

TIP: This enables new applications for Tower: different Job Templates can build upon each other. E.g. the networking team creates playbooks with their own content, in their own Git repository and even targeting their own inventory, while the operations team also has their own repos, playbooks and inventory.

In this lab you'll learn how to setup a workflow.
